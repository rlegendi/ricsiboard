## Backlog

* New page / FAQ
* OG recommendations
* Twitter feed widget?
* Config page - make more consistent. Buttons vs. links ain't good
* Get review :-)
* Validate that there are no , and | characters within the paramsTable category fields
* Exclude tests from deploy
* Add other settings such as: https://www.tradingview.com/widget/symbol-overview/
  * Do we need consent dialog for saving this to localstorage or stg?

### Later maybe

* Feature - Rightclick -> Add trendlines somehow?
* Feature - Add chart with button (search tickers)
* Mobile - Params table is pretty much screwed up and unusable

## For the review to discuss

* ; or not to ;
* Eliminate JQuery? Needs Bootstrap update, lot of work
* Global state or local state - params enough hidden hm?
* More functional approach?
