Story
=====

Why to listen?

	How you can utilize a pet project to learn
	
	Relevant for full stack
	
	Relevant about Cloud hosting stuff

	How pet project fails / theprimaegen vid had good thoughts

Why?
	- Personal investments
	  Tiktoker woman saying it's not a financial advice but hahaha
	  There was a YouTube vid I saw about influencers doing pump and dump 
	- Important for work
	  Stakeholders talk differently when the company does well
	  Their compensation has stock in the US for sure
	  Acquisitions / e.g., Oracle Cerner, Activision and MS, show examples

Interested:
	- ONLY in price
	  No noise of indicatros --- maybe picture about a terrible setup
	  I get headaches
	- Long-term trends
	  I don't care about daily moves
	- No install
	- No fckn popups
	- Use on desktop, mobile
	- Shareable configs - good basis for discussion w/ friends

Tech stuff

	No tracking cookies, how to monitor usage?
		CDN is great for that - show screenshot
	
	Testing
		JUnit spoiled me, did not really like any of the frameworks
		Saying this as someone who contributed to ScalaTest and Specs and stuff
	
Things that I learnt
	OG stuff
	A bit of SEO - last time I wrote webpage the keyword meta was stg

Limitations
	URL - works up to 2048 chars / tocheck! win cmd doesn't work, but maybe spec allows
	Server side - out of scope
		Supposed to be a quick and fun project, huge work, low ROI

Gotchas
	CDN invalidation is a must after deploy, otherwise it's a day until you see updated content
	
Cost
	$12 for domain reg
	$0.5 for Route 53
	$0.5 for Route 53
	otherwise static website hosting

Arch
	Minimal deployment / logical diagram

Tools
	Audit for cookies

Links
	Learning week talk about another AWS pet project I had

What to contribute?
	Ideas
	Review my shtty code
	Increasing test coverage
	Running it against some static code analysis tools
	TODO notes from the readme

Plans
	Add React / check if there are any more fancier new stuff out there, I'm sure there is lol. It's FE :D

Q&A
	If you guys don't have, I have haha. So I can learn stg too.
	If I store chart config in local store - do I need user consent?
		Or any other ideas how to solve it? I just need a template

Contact
	Twitter - occassional major updates
